#Tech-Tut-Lister

Tech-Tut-lister is an app that allows programmers to share and promote tech tutorials that best help explain and teach technical subjects. Visitors (non-registered members) can visit the site to gain quick reviews on tutorials or recommendations where to start learning a technical subject. Users (registered members) are given the ability to post links to tutorials while providing their own comments, ratings, and curriculum suggestions.
